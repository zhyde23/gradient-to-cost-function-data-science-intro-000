    "In the previous lesson, we learned the mathematical definition of a gradient.  We saw that the gradient of a function was a combination of our partial derivatives with respect to each variable of that function.  We saw the process of gradient descent involves moving in the negative direction of the gradient.  For example, if the direction of ascent of a function is a move up and to the right, the descent is down and to the left. In this lesson we will apply gradient descent to our cost function to see how we can move toward a best fit regression line by changing the variables of $m$ and $b$.  "

So in the graph directly below, $x_i$ and $y_i$  would be our points representing a movie's budget and revenue.  Meanwhile, $mx_i + b $ is our predicted $y$ value for a given $x$ value, of a budget. \n",

Then we square this difference, and sum up these squares for each piece of data in our dataset.  That is the residual sum of squares."
